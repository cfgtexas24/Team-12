# Team-12

We implemented the following features to respond to STORM's mission:
- Emergency forms and messaging for instant responses from staff
- A virtual meeting space for fellow students to network and interact
- A robust admin panel for the memebers of the STORM staff to track user analytics
- A gamified life-skills training program to empower and educate youth <br /> <br /> The code ("Code") in this repository was created solely by the student teams during a coding competition hosted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMC"). JPMC did not create or contribute to the development of the Code.
