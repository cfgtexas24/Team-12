We implemented the following features to respond to STORM's mission:
- Emergency forms and messaging for instant responses from staff
- A virtual meeting space for fellow students to network and interact
- A robust admin panel for the memebers of the STORM staff to track user analytics
- A gamified life-skills training program to empower and educate youth
