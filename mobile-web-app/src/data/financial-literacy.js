    text: 'From the age of 18 it’s likely that you’ll start living away from home for at least part of the year, either to study or to start a job in another part of the country. As a student, even if you spend your first year in student accommodation, you’ll probably move into rented accommodation with other students at some point. For your first job, even if it’s close enough for you to stay in the family home, as time moves on there’s a high chance you’ll want to move out, particularly if you’re in a long-term relationship. Although the timeline varies, and whatever the reason for your move away, there’s a high chance you’ll find yourself living in a shared rental with people of your own age. This means changes to your budget, and it’s these changes that you focus on here.'
