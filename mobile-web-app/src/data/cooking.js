    text: `Much like balancing your budget or keeping houseplants alive, cooking is a skill that requires both knowledge and practice. And while it might be a joy to attend cooking school, who’s got the time? We did the work and boiled the world of cooking down to 10 basic skills that will make your meals so much easier (and delicious!). Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, bone up on these 10 essential cooking skills.
    1. Master the Art of Boiling
We know, boiling seems beyond basic; What could be more essential than filling a pot, putting it on high, and letting the water rip? Boiling water—and lower-temperature techniques like steaming and poaching—opens up tons of delicious meal options. When you learn to harness the power of boiling you can make delicious weeknight pasta dishes, make basic stocks and broths, poach eggs for brunch and fish for dinner parties. You can meal-prep basics like hard cooked eggs or steam simple vegetables like broccoli and sweet potatoes for the weeknight side. And how can we forget soup? Boiling is essential to soothing, budget-friendly pots of soup and beans. 

Here’s what you need to know about boiling: For cooking, there are three types of boils: rolling, slow, or simmer. A rolling boil is the classic 212 F pot of rumbling, vivacious bubbles. A rolling boil is most often used for cooking pasta and hard-cooking eggs. Pro tip: Water will come to a boil faster without salt, so salt your pasta pot after it is actively boiling. A slow boil is approximately 205 F and most often used for making broth and stock. A simmer ranges from 205 to 190 F. You’ll want to know how to simmer for cooking dried beans as well as creating rich, meaty braises.
2. How To Cut an Onion the Right Way
Basic knife skills are essential to faster, easier cooking because when your onions (or carrots or chicken cutlets) are all about the same size they cook more evenly. An onion is almost always used as the example of proper knife skills because it is also the most basic aromatic for everything from everyday chili to holiday roasts. But the fundamentals of cutting an onion apply to other produce as well: Remove the stem and peel, cut into manageable pieces with a flat steady side and then cut it into smaller pieces methodically. 

Here’s what you need to know about cutting an onion the right way: Cut basic white, yellow, and red onions like this: Trim off the top of the onion—leave the root in place to make cutting easier. Remove the peel. Halve the onion lengthwise. Then, working with one half at a time, position the onion cut side down with the cut top parallel to the knife. With your knife parallel to the cutting board, make ¼ inch slices of the onion working from the bottom to the top, making wide planks of onion, and stopping before you hit the root. Then hold your knife as you normally would and start cutting downward perpendicular to the cut top. Finally, turn the onion 90 degrees and slice through all those slices to get a finely chopped onion.`
